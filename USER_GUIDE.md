# SharkSpin Player Guide

Welcome to the SharkSpin command deck! This guide walks you through every surface inside the mini app so you never miss a reward.

## Launching the Mini App

1. Open the SharkSpin bot in Telegram and tap **Open SharkSpin** (available via `/start`, `/me`, or `/buy`).
2. The command deck loads with a hero banner showing your live **Level**, **SharkCoins**, **Energy**, and **Wheel Tokens**.
3. Use the fixed taskbar at the bottom to jump between **Main Spin**, **Wheel of Tides**, **Albums**, **Shop**, and **Help**.

## Daily Captain’s Log

* The gold chest card beneath the hero banner displays your streak status and the next reward preview.
* Claim once every 24 hours to keep the streak alive. Missing more than 48 hours resets it.
* Streak milestones (configured for days like 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21…) add bonus Wheel Tokens on top of coins and energy.
* The claim button is disabled while you are on cooldown and shows a countdown instead.

## Main Spin Bay

* Pick a multiplier chip (x1–x5) to set your wager. Higher multipliers cost more energy but scale the payout.
* Tap **Spin the Main Cab** to fire the reels. Icons award resources:
  * **🪙 SharkCoins** – spend these on sticker packs or to show off your earnings.
  * **⚡ Energy** – refills the spin meter so you can keep playing.
  * **🌀 Wheel Tokens** – grants attempts on the Wheel of Tides.
  * **💠 / 🎁 / 🦈** – premium symbols that enhance coin and hybrid payouts.
* Double matches multiply rewards 2×, triple matches 3×, and shark resonances add 1.5× flair.
* The result banner summarizes exactly what you won (coins, energy, tokens) plus the spin label.
* The level progress bar updates immediately with XP earned from your winnings.

## Wheel of Tides

* Spend a Wheel Token or use your free cooldown spin to activate the neon wheel.
* The glowing frame and center badge update automatically as you edit wheel art assets.
* Rewards include coin bursts, energy storms, extra spins, and sticker packs—check the colored slice labels.
* Wheel results apply instantly to your balance.

## Sticker Albums

* Each album card shows cost per pack, completion percentage, and rewards for finishing the set.
* Tap **Open Pack** to spend SharkCoins and reveal a random sticker from that album.
* Duplicate stickers stay in your inventory; completing the set auto-grants bonus spins and energy.
* Album lists refresh after every pack so you can see progress at a glance.

## Star Shop

* The shop tab lists curated Telegram Star bundles configured by the admins.
* Each card shows the art badge, Stars price, energy payload, and bonus Wheel Tokens.
* Tap **Purchase in-app** to open the Telegram Stars payment sheet without leaving SharkSpin.
* After payment completes, the bot credits energy and tokens automatically and your stats refresh.

## Help & Operations Briefing

* The Help tab mirrors this user guide with expandable cards explaining mechanics, streak logic, and admin-controlled systems.
* The Operations Briefing panel on the Main Spin view highlights current systems (daily rewards, events, shop, etc.) with quick reference icons.

## Telegram Commands
