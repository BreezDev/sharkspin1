# SharkSpin Player Guide

Welcome to the SharkSpin command deck! This guide walks you through every surface inside the mini app so you never miss a reward.

## Launching the Mini App

1. Open the SharkSpin bot in Telegram and tap **Open SharkSpin** (available via `/start`, `/me`, or `/buy`).
2. The command deck loads with a compact resource bar and level strip pinned to the top that tracks your **SharkCoins**, **Energy**, **Wheel Spins**, and current XP progress.
3. Use the fixed taskbar at the bottom to jump between **Main Spin**, **Wheel of Tides**, **Albums**, **Shop**, and **Help**.

## Daily Captain’s Log

* The gold chest card beneath the hero banner displays your streak status and the next reward preview.
* Claim once every 24 hours to keep the streak alive. Missing more than 48 hours resets it.
* Wheel Tokens only appear on long streak milestones (7, 14, 21…) and always arrive as a single token; energy trickles in every fourth claim—plan around the drought.
* The claim button is disabled while you are on cooldown and shows a countdown instead.

## Main Spin Bay

* Pick a multiplier chip (x1, x2, x5, … up to x1500) to set your wager. Higher multipliers multiply the 3⚡ / 75🪙 cost along with potential payouts.
* Tap **Spin the Main Cab** to fire the reels. Icons award resources:
  * **🪙 SharkCoins** – expect most spins to lose net coins; only rare streaks beat the house edge.
  * **⚡ Energy** – refunded only by the ⚡ and 🦈 symbols.
* **🌀 Wheel Tokens** – granted by the 🌀 or 🦈 symbols, tuned to be rarer than energy, and always limited to a single token per spin.
  * **💠 / 🎁** – premium symbols that amplify coin returns but still respect the house cut.
* Double matches multiply base rewards 2×, triple matches 3×, and shark resonances add 1.5× flair before the house edge reductions apply.
* The result banner summarizes the wager, the resources returned, and your coin net.
* The level progress bar updates immediately with XP earned from whatever coins you actually bank.

## Wheel of Tides

* Spend exactly one Wheel Token to activate the neon wheel (no more free cooldown spins by default).
* The glowing frame and center badge update automatically as you edit wheel art assets.
* Rewards skew toward coin bursts. Energy drips and bonus tokens are intentionally rare—tweak slice weights from the admin panel if needed.
* Wheel results apply instantly to your balance.

## Sticker Albums

* Each album card shows cost per pack, completion percentage, and the single Wheel Token reward for finishing the set.
* Tap **Open Pack** to spend SharkCoins and reveal a random sticker from that album.
* Duplicate stickers stay in your inventory; completing the set auto-grants bonus spins and energy.
* Album lists refresh after every pack so you can see progress at a glance.

## Star Shop

* The shop tab lists curated Telegram Star bundles configured by the admins.
* Each card shows the art badge, Stars price, energy payload, and whether a rare +1 Wheel Token is included.
* Tap **Purchase in-app** to open the Telegram Stars payment sheet without leaving SharkSpin.
* After payment completes, the bot credits energy and (if applicable) the single Wheel Token automatically and your stats refresh. Admins can add or retire bundles live from `/admin/shop`.

## Help & Operations Briefing

* The Help tab mirrors this user guide with expandable cards explaining mechanics, streak logic, and admin-controlled systems.
* The Operations Briefing panel on the Main Spin view highlights current systems (daily rewards, events, shop, etc.) with quick reference icons.

## Telegram Commands

* `/start` – receive the welcome message and mini-app launch button.
* `/me` – check your balance and open the mini app.
* `/buy` – view Star pack summaries and open the shop tab.
* Admins only: `/reward` issues signed reward links that launch directly into the mini app.
